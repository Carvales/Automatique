# Control Systems Visualisation Tools

## Description
This repository is intended for :
- Control System students who need to experience stuff in order to learn. 
- Control System professors who want to include visual, practical and pedagogical elements in their lectures.

Matlab applications (designed with appdesigner) are proposed to visualize and understand systems.

## Available tools:

- Desgin and Visualisation of PID Regulator
  * New version : PID_visu.mlapp
  * Old version : Controllers_App

- Visualization and control of an Inverted Pendulum
  * Inverted_pendulum.mlapp
@ Inspired by Steve Brunton courses on Inverted Pendulum Cart

Note : Available tools are functional but can still evolve (add features, bug corrections, etc.)

## Tools planned:
- Pole placement visualization
- Visualisation and control of a water tank
